#include<cstdlib>
Now we can allocate and de-allocate heap memory dynamically.

1)Allocating a pointer of type int* to point to 
	int* ptr = (int*)malloc(100*sizeof(int));
It initializes each memory block with garbage
Memory can be accessed like ptr[2]

2)Allocating contigiuous memory
	int* ptr = (int*)calloc(100,sizeof(int));
It initializes each memory block with 0
Memory can be accessed like ptr[2]

3)Deallocating memory
	free(ptr)

4)Reallocating memory
	ptr = realloc(ptr , newSize )
  It copies existing values
  If newSize is more than initial array size, the remaining is
  filled with garbage. If it is less, the part of data outside 
  is lost.
