The following format is useful:

	//Forward declare all classes
	class A ;
	class B;

	//Define all the classes with their member variables. Inside classes forward declare all member functions
	class A{
		private:
		int x ;
		public:
		int f();
	};
	class B{
		private:
		char y ;
		public:
		bool g();
	};

	//Define all member functions
	int A::f(){
		cout << "f" << endl ;
	}
	bool B::g(){
		cout<< "g" << endl ;
	}

The first two parts may also be placed in a seperate header file and it can be included in the main file having the third part.
