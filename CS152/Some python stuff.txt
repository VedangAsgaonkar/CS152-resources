1)
l = [1,2,3]
l2 = l 
l2.append(4)
print(l)
if l2 is l:
	print("hello")

Output >> [1,2,3,4]
       >> hello	
Thus it is the same object
To produce a copy, do
l2 = l.copy()

In python we have membership operator in .
It makes the code reversible. It doesnot require a mutable variable which is set to
new values as the loop proceeds ( that would have made the code irreversible as set on
a mutable variable leads to irreversible erasing and replacing in the memory).
