A typedef is an alias for a existing data type. It is used to provide more readability and avoid long data type names. The new data type behaves exactly like the old
one. The old one can of course also be used. For example:
	typedef int color ;
	typedef std::vector<std::string> sentence ;
They can now be used as 
	color a = 1 ;
	sentence b;
	b.append("The") ;
The typedef is just an alias, and there is an implicit casting between the two types.
