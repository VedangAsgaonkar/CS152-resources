The game implements the priests and devils puzzle, in which all have to cross the river using a boat that carries only 2. Also on any side, at any time, the number of devils must
not exceed the number of priests.
The game is built by first extending the Fl_Widget class in Shape class. This is an abstract class that declares virtual functions refresh() and wipe().
The MyRectangle class then inherits the Shape class and overrides the virtual methods. Also additional methods draw() and moveTo() are defined.
The being class of which the priests and demons are instances, extends MyRectangle, so that these people can be given the basic body shape. It also
has variables holding the current position of these beings. Also the class overrides handle() allowing the beings to climb into the boat. Priests are
shown green and devils are red.
Certain variables have been declared globally to provide ease of access.
The window also has a go button that is an instance of the MyButton class that extendes Fl_Button. The handle() method of this class is the central 
controller of the game. It makes the boat go from shore to shore. It also detects when the game is over due the number of devils being more on one
shore than the number of priests. It can also detect wins. When either of this happens, it throws an integer. This causes all the variables declared
in the try of main to go out of scope, killing the window. The exception is caught by catch, which according to the integer thrown prints a suitable
result.
