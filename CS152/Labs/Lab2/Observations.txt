OBSERVATIONS:

The programming paradigm being used is OOP. Hence I have defined classes Floor and Lift in both the programs. 

The Floor class contains two private bool variables to store the state of the up and the down buttons on the particular 
floor. It also has public member functions to set the values of these variables.

The Lift class is equiped with a private int variable to store its current position. It has a public member function
to initialize it at some floor. It also has a goTo() function to send it to a specified floor.

The main() contains a sequence of passengers entering and exiting the lift system and choosing their destinations.

In the singleLift program the lone lift has to attend to all calls. In order to make the functioning efficient, the lift
tries to go monotonically in one direction as far as required.

In the twoLift program the lifts share the workload. Each lift attends to its nearest call. The lifts also try to optimize
their own functioning by moving monotonically as much as required.
