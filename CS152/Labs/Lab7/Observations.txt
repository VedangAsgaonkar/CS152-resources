PriestsAndDevils.cpp is the old code from lab6. Certain changes have been made in PriestsAndDevils1.cpp.
The following changes were made:
1) All global variables were made local in main. They were passed by pointer to the class methods wherever
   required. This provides better security to the variables.
2) All class variables were made private, except wherever required. This provides better security, seperation
   of concerns and encapsulation.
3) The process of destroying the window was made more sophesticated. The earlier version relied on using
   the destructor by making the window go out of scope using a try-catch block and an exception thrown by
   one of the objects. This version passes the window pointer by pointer to the object and the object can
   terminate the window by using hide() method.
4) A logical error has been corrected. In the earlier version the boat could cross the river without a
   person sailing it. That has now been corrected.
