1)collection.cpp:
	An output/pop operator >> was overloaded. Also + was overloaded to allow merging of collections
2)complex.cpp:
	The operators +,-,* were overloaded to perform complex algebra. Right to left precedence of * was observed.
3)exceptions.cpp:
	Nested try, catch statements were used and nested exceptions were handled. Also exception objects were passed
	by reference, thus demonstrating that the scope of an object created in try, but caught in catch remains till
	the catch ends.
4)trythis1.cpp and trythis2.cpp:
	Entirely erratic behaviour is observed in precedence of () and ++ .
5)why-it-fails.cpp:
	It fails because << has higher precedence than || ,  so the second part is a << applied on a bool.
6)evaloder1.cpp:
	The first-increment-then-use behaviour of prefix++ is observed.
7)lval-rval.cpp:
	An error is observed in case the comment is removed, because of x++ not being an lvalue.
