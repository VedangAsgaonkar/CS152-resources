Observations:
1)path.pl:	The original version of the code gives all correct paths, but after that it goes into infinite recursion.
	The reason is that it keeps searching for paths and keeps calling the last clause. The code has been changed to check for edges
	preventing this infinite recursion. 
2)reward.pl: The original program shows multiple solutions to the same query. After introduction of ! the backtracking is stopped after
	one solution has been detected.
3)sibling.pl: Again the use of cut(!) is seen.
