Given a data-type of the std template library, we can perform member based iterations on it, as follows:

//let the datatype object be v

for(auto& u : v){
  // process u
}

Note that we are making a reference here. Doing for(auto u : v) will cause the members to get copied 
and so any changes made to them will not affect the original data structure

We may also have to use the form 

for(const auto& u : v){

}

in cases where the v may be a temporary object.
