# CS152-resources
This repository stores CS152 notes for my future reference. Making this public means that future batches may benefit from it. Any corrections/ feedback/ occasional bars of chocolate are welcome.
Note that the resources here do not cover the whole course. The following have been skipped:
* Some labs
* Lambda calculus
* Logic programming and Prolog engine functioning

I shall provide some resources for the latter two.

#### Lambda Calculus

#### Prolog Engine Functionality
